# Hide and show attributes

Sometimes there are just too many attributes. 
It would be great to get most of them out of the way.

Here is the plan:

* Launch `Choosy` from the **Plugins** menu.
* Click the **Attributes** tab.
* Use the green and gray slidey buttons on the left 
to hide and show the attributes you want.

![The `Choosy` attributes panel](art/choosy-attributes-nhanes-example.png)
:::

As you do that, 
watch how the table hides and shows the attributes.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Notes 

When you hide an attribute, you're only hiding it. 
It's still there with all of its data.

Also, when you're done adjusting your attributes, 
go ahead and close `choosy`. 
You can always open it again by picking it from the **Plugins** menu.
And it will remember which attributes are currently hidden.

Finally, if you click on the blue "info" circles, 
`Choosy` will show you the comments about the attribute.
