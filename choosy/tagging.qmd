# Tagging cases

There are three flavors of tagging.
Choose which one using the buttons at the top of `choosy`.

![](art/tag-simple-binary-random.png)

* **simple**: You tag the selection with some value, 
and the other cases are blank.
* **binary**: You tag the selection with some value, 
and the other cases get some other value.
* **random**: You tag a random sample of the cases with some value,
and the rest get another value.

Each of these is described on the screen.
Enter the values you want to tag with, 
and possibly edit the name of the attribute you want to hold the tags.
Then press the green "plus" button to add the tags.

Additional notes:

* In the **simple** case, tagging a new selection adds it to the tagged set. 
Likewise, un-tagging removes the selection from the tagged set. 
This is useful for making more complicated selections.
* The **random** case is great for making a random sample, of course, 
but also perfect for making a training set and a test set 
when you're thinking about machine learning.

## Using the tags

Once you have your cases tagged, you can use the tag attribute
as you would any categorical attribute.

For example, you can plop it into a graph to make a legend:

![We used the graph on the left to create a tag for all people who are married or separated. Then we plopped that `Tag` into the graph on the right.](art/simple-tag-plop-example.png)

You can make a separate graph using that attribute.

![We made a new tag (`Triglyc`) that indicates normal triglycerides.
We put it on the horizontal axis of the graph on the left.
The `Tag` tag (married or separated) is still there.](art/tag-triglycerides-150.png)

You can also use a legend or a graph to re-select the original selection. 
Once you have done that, you can hide or set aside cases
to focus on that subset of your data.

## To tag or not to tag?

Suppose you want to tag all the people with `Age` between 18 and 25.
You could make a graph of `Age` and select that range,
and tag them.

But you might mess up your selection.
If the precise ages are important, 
it's probably better to make a new column yourself and give it a formula.
 
 Having said that, some groups of data are just easier
 to select than to write a formula for. 
 In those cases, by all means, use `choosy` and tagging.

 For example, suppose you want to find all of the 
 females between 18 and 25 who are taller than 5 feet 8
 (perhaps they are the basketball prospects).
 The formula will be long and awkward.
 If you want to grab that group quickly,
 make the appropriate graph(s) and select the people you want.
