# Batches of attributes

`Choosy` lets you create and name sets of attributes, called *batches*.

::: {.column-margin}
![We are just about to create a batch named `demographics`](art/choosy-batch-name.png)

![We have just added `BornIn` to the `demographics` batch. You can also see a `blood` batch, which has been suppressed by pressing the eye icon with the slash. ](art/choosy-batch-demographics.png)
:::

* Enter the batch name in the box and press `enter`.
A new batch "stripe" appears at the bottom of the list of variables.
* Drag an attribute you want to be in that batch and 
drop it on the stripe. 

::: {.callout-tip}

You may need to drop it on an empty part of the stripe (not the name of the batch). 
The stripe turns yellow when you're in the right place.
:::

* Click the eyeball icons to hide or show all attributes in that batch.
* Click the triangle to collapse or expand 
the list of attributes in that batch.ftp
* If you move all of the attributes out of a batch, it disappears.
