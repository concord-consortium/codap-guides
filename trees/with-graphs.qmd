title: "Trees and graphs"
---

How should you decide how to build a tree?
What attributes should you drag in?
How do you pick a cut point?

You could just try things, 
but it often helps to make graphs:
graphs that show the relationship between the attribute you're wondering about
and your target variable. 

For example, here are two graphs of the same data 
showing the `height` of 28 professional athletes
and what their sport is.
In this case, all of these athletes play either rugby or basketball.
That attribute, `sport`, is our target variable.
That is, we are trying to use `height` to predict what sport they play.

::: {.column-margin}
Two ways to show `sport` and `height`. As we might expect, basketball players are generally taller.

Which display is best? You will have to decide what works for you.
Be sure you remember that you have a choice!
:::

We could use either graph to decide on a cut point. 
It looks as if it's something like 175 cm. 

In the live example make a tree...

* ...that's predicting `sport`
* ...that branches on `height`
* ...at a number near 175 cm
* ...and that predicts that the taller athletes play basketball,
and the rest rugby.
