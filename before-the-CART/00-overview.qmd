Each of the headings below corresponds to a section in the
table of contents on the left.

[Anatomy of a tree](10-arbor-anatomy.qmd)
: Learn how to read a tree, using data from the *Titanic* disaster.

[Your first tree](20-arbor-begin.qmd)
: The basics of how to make a tree using *Arbor*.

<!--
Trees and graphs
: Trees and graphs are both ways of looking at the data. 
And they are intimately connected.
Learn how to use graphs to help you make the best trees.
-->

[Fbola example](40-arbor-fbola.qmd)
: Another example dataset, this time in a medical context.
Use the tree to decide who probably has the virus.

[How good is your tree?](50-arbor-measures.qmd)
: What makes a tree a *good* tree?
*Arbor* can help you calculate tree quality.

[Breast cancer data](60-arbor-breast-cancer.qmd)
: With a numerical predictor, we create our own measure of tree quality,
and use it with graphs to make the best tree.

<!--
Machine learning connection
: Classification is an important topic in machine learning.
This explains the connection and how work with *Arbor* might fit in. 
-->

[The configuration box](90-arbor-configuration.qmd)
: When you "configure" a node in a tree, there is a dialog box.
This explains all of its controls.
