These pages are an online supplement for a paper
in _Teaching Statistics_ called 
_What goes before the CART? 
Introducing classification trees with Arbor and CODAP_
by Joachim Engel and Tim Erickson.

These pages give you, the reader, 
a chance to build trees using the _Arbor_ tool 
and get a feel for using CODAP.
We have also incorporated this material into a 
much larger online book, 
[Awash in Data](https://concord.org/awashindata).

[CODAP](https://codap.concord.org) is a free, web-based data analysis platform.
_Arbor_ is a CODAP plugin that helps you make classification trees.

To learn CODAP basics, here are two strategies:

* Work through the [getting started lesson](https://codap.xyz/awash/lessons-overview.html#the-getting-started-lesson) in the "Awash" book.
* Open CODAP, choose to get a sample document, and choose **Getting started with CODAP**.
