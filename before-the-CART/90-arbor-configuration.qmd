# Configuring a node: the details


When you press the "gear" that appears when you hover over a node,
the configuration box appears. 
That's where you can set the cutpoint for a numeric attribute.

You can do other useful things as well.

You will be able to figure this box out pretty well on your own, 
but just in case, this page explains all the gory details.

## Left and right

The double-headed arrow diamond near the lower right is a button
that reverses the node. 
With that control, you can (for example) set up every branching
so that the more "positive" result flows to the left. 
A tree is less confusing if the results are less mixed up.


## Cutpoints

If the attribute is numeric, you have to decide what number separates 
the positive from the negative values. 

Enter the number you want for the cutpoint and use the menu to 
choose the operator that governs which value(s) go on the left.

Notice that you *can* use equality. 
This is useful when you want to isolate a single value for some reason.

## More than two categorical values

Suppose you have four values in the columns, 
such as `Freshman`, `Sophomore`, `Junior`, and `Senior`. 
By default, *Arbor* picks one value for the left side, and puts the rest on the right:

!["Before." Frosh are alone on the left.](art/configure-categorical-before.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

Now suppose you want to split a node by whether the cases are upper or lower class.

Just click on a *value* to move it to the other side. 
For example, clicking on the **Soph** button will move it to the left side.
It will look like this, although you have to edit the labels as we did:

!["After." Frosh and sophomores are together on the left.](art/configure-categorical-after.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}


## Labels

The text in the **Labels** boxes appears on the tree,
attached to the links to the "child" nodes.

Enter whatever you want, in order to make the tree clear and correct.

If you have a numerical attribute and a cutpoint,
*Awash* automatically fills in the label with an operator and a value.
