# Trees and graphs

How should you decide how to build a tree? What attributes should you drag in? How do you pick a cut point?

You could just try things, but it often helps to make graphs: graphs that show the relationship between the attribute you're wondering about and your target variable.

For example, here are two graphs of the same data showing the `height` of 28 professional athletes and what their sport is. In this case, all of these athletes play either rugby or basketball. That attribute, `sport`, is our target variable. That is, we are trying to use `height` to predict what sport they play.

Two ways to show `sport` and `height`. As we might expect, basketball players are generally taller.

Which display is best? You will have to decide what works for you. Be sure you remember that you have a choice!

We could use either graph to decide on a cut point. It looks as if it's something like 175 cm.

In the live example, experiment with different graphs.
For example, do you think `weight` might be as good or better than `height` for separating 
basketball players from rugby players?

Be sure to try making a graph with a *legend*. 
To make a legend (and color the points), 
plop an attribute in the *middle* of a graph.

Don't be afraid to make multiple graphs.
You might want to minimize or shrink the tree to make room!

Time for an exercise!
In the live example make a tree...

-   ...that's predicting `sport`
-   ...that branches on `height`
-   ...at a number near 175 cm
-   ...and that predicts that the taller athletes play basketball, and the rest rugby.
