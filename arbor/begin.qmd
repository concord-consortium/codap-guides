Let's learn to drive!
We will begin by exploring a dataset about the passengers aboard the *Titanic*. 
This is the goal:


![You will make this tree showing data about passengers on the Titanic.
Notice the huge gender difference in survival rates.](art/titanic-3-leaves.png){width=80%}


### The target attribute

To make a tree, you first have to identify your *target attribute*.
The target attribute might also be called

* the dependent variable
* the outcome variable
* the effect


It's the thing you are trying to predict.
In the case of the Titanic data, it's `fate`:
we want to know what makes it more likely to have survived the disaster.

In the live example below, start your tree by dragging `fate` 
from the table at the right and dropping it into the
middle of the blank, gray tree panel.
You should see that 500 of the 1309 people survived.

<script>
    const theURL = "https://codap.concord.org/releases/latest/static/dg/en/cert/index.html#shared=https%3A%2F%2Fcfm-shared.concord.org%2F3yRWcBkixaw5u5Pq4jSY%2Ffile.json";
    awash.liveDemoAt(theURL);
</script>
:::

### Making a branch: drag and drop

Next, drop `sex` onto the white box with "500 of 1309" in it.  
The tree will branch.
You can see how the survival rate was different for males and females. 

Notice that the tree is composed of boxes (called *nodes*)
and lines (*links*).

::: {.callout-tip}
## Lost in the Node?

It's easy to lose track of what's going on in a node.
When that happens, just point at the node. 
Don't click, just hover for a moment,
and text will pop up describing that node in more detail.

::: {.column-margin}
![The pop-up information for the "male" node](art/titanic-node-info.png)
:::


### Adding a numeric attribute

Now drop `age` onto the "male" node.
It will split, but probably using age 30 as a cutpoint.
Click the gear on the `age` stripe and change that 30 to 15.

::: {.column-margin}
![Configuring `age`: setting the cutpoint to 15.](art/age-config.png)
:::

When you make a tree with *Arbor*, every node has a maximum of two branches.
An attribute like `age` has so many values,
you generally have to tell _Arbor_ where that cutpoint is using that configuration box.

You can configure any attribute,
but it's more common for numerical ones. 

### Assigning results to terminal nodes

::: {.column-margin}
![Your tree should look like this after you have
assigned its leaf nodes to be `survived` or `died`.](art/titanic-3-leaves.png)
:::

Now your tree should look like the one up at the top of the page...
except that you still have to assign 
the *terminal nodes* --- the leaves of the tree --- to an outcome.
Do that by clicking on the leaf nodes repeatedly until you see what you want.
