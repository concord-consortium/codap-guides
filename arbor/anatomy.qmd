What does an *Arbor* tree look like?
How do you read it?
Let's look at an example.
This tree shows data from a famous dataset about the 1309 passengers aboard the *Titanic*. 
We will explore what seems to affect whether the passengers survived.

![Later, you will make this tree!](art/titanic-3-leaves.png)

First of all, this tree---like most trees in data analysis---is upside-down. 
The root and trunk are at the top, and the leaves are at the bottom. 

### The root node

So: way up at the top, the "root" block, the root *node*, looks like this:

![](art/anatomy-root.png){width=60% fig-align="center"}

The first horizontal "stripe" tells us what *attribute* we are trying to predict. 
In this dataset, it's called `fate`. 
(The value of `fate` is either `survived` or `died`.)

The second stripe tells us that we will consider `survived` to be the "positive" result. 
That seems obvious, but in many medical contexts,
a "positive" test means that you have the disease. 

### The trunk node

Just below the root is the trunk. 
That block, that node, also has two stripes. 

The top one tells you that 500 of the 1309 people---38.2% of them---survived.
You know it's survived because of what it says in the root.
But if you forget, or get confused, you can always hover over that  node to see details:

![](art/anatomy-trunk-hover.png){width=60% fig-align="center"}

The bottom stripe sets up a branching.
In this case, we ask about `gender`,
and branch one way if the person is female and the other way if they are male. 


### Other nodes

Every other node is structured more or less the same as the trunk node: 
the first stripe shows how many people are positive, that is, how many survived,
and the second shows the branching if there is one. 

The key thing about the number stripe is that it only considers the people
who get to that point in the tree. 
So although 38% of all people survived, the tree shows us that there is a big gender difference:
73% of the females survived, but only 19% of the males. 

And then, among the males, the *young* males---under 15 years old---had 
a 50% survival rate compared to about 18% for males 15 or older.

### Terminal nodes: the leaves

If a node has no branches coming out of it, it is a *terminal* node. 
Every terminal node has a "leaf" below it that is rounded instead of rectangular.
The leaf shows a prediction for the `fate` of the people in that category.

So for the females, our best guess is that they will survive.
For older males, our best guess is that they will die.

For the young males, under 15, with a 50% survival rate, 
we're predicting survival, 
although you can make a case that at 50% we shouldn't predict.
The other side of that argument is that they have a better chance than people in general (38%).

### The links

Slanted white stripes, called *links*, connect nodes to their "children." 
Every link has a label such as `female` or `>= 15` so you can tell who that link applies to.

So: that's how you read a tree!
