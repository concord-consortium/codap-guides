## Conditionals (and conditional probability)

Sometimes, in probability, the chance of some event depends on the outcome of some other (usually _previous_) event.

For example, suppose you flip a coin. 
If you get heads, you roll a six-sided die.
But if you get tails, you roll an eight-sided die.
What's the probability that you roll a three?

Here is a program that does the simulation:

![](art/condition-program.png){width="80%" fig-align="center"}

This program includes a couple of new features.

* the `"heads"` block is in the `Text` section.
Bring the empty text into the workspace and edit it there.
* the `if` statement lives in the `Control and Loops` section. 
But how do you get the "else"?

### Getting `else`
The tricky part about is how you get the `else` clause. 

1. Get an `if` block.

#. Click the gear on the `if` block. 
An additional "configuration" palette appears.

#. Drag the little `else` blocklet from the left and attach it to the little `if`.

#. (Crucial!) To make the palette go away, _click the gear again_.

### Your turn!

* Make the program in the live illustration below.
* Wrap it in a loop and run it a few hundred times.
* Compute an empirical value for the probability of rolling a three.
* See if you can solve the problem theoretically and compare!

### Problem: Penelope shoots two

Penelope is playing basketball and is shooting from the free-throw line. 
If she doesn't make her first shot, she is done and gets zero points. 
If makes her first shot, she gets one point ... and she gets a second shot.

* Her chance of making the first shot is 65%.
* Her chance of making the second shot is 80%.

What are the possible results for Penelope, 
and what are their probabilities? 

Make a simulation to model this situation in the live CODAP window below,
and run it many times to figure out the probabiities. 
If you can, solve the problem theoretically and compare.
