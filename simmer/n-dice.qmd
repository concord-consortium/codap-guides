## $n$ dice

You've just done 10 dice. 
Clearly, you could add any number of dice by changing the 
number `10` in that loop block.
Here is a different way to do this:

The difference is, instead of a number in the loop ("repeat 10 times")
we have a variable ("repeat $n$ times").
Make sure you understand why this program
will roll 42 dice and add the results.

A single run looks like this; your results will vary:

Why would you want to write it this way?

* If you want to change how many dice get rolled, 
you can change the number up at the top;
you don't have to search through the code to find the number.
* Since `n` is a variable in the program, it gets output to CODAP.
That is, we know the sum of `140` comes from a roll of 42 dice.
