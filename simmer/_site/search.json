We have a block that represents a variable (named item), and it “receives” a random number. Then we send that data to CODAP.\n\nIn the live example below, try to build that program. Some hints:\n\nThe gray stripe on the left is called the toolbox.\nThe toolbox contains the names of categories. Click on a name to see the blocks in that category.\nFind the blocks you need in three different categories.\nDrag blocks from the toolbox into the main workspace and hook them together.\nIf you get one you don’t want, you can drag it to the trash can in the lower right.\n\nSee how you do:\n\n\n\n\nWhen you have it the way you want, press the run button (the green circle). A CODAP table appears with your data in it. Run the program a few more times and see how the value of item changes.\nBecause it’s in CODAP, you can make a graph the usual way.\n\n\n\nDoes item look evenly distributed? (Probably not!)"

    "text": "Two dice\nOne die is great…but what could be better? Two dice! More than twice as good.\nWe give you a fresh, blank simmer document below. You can start fresh right there or modify what you did above. Try to make a program like this one:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNames are important\n\n\n\nGive your variables meaningful names. Names like die and die2 tell you what’s going on.\nWhen we were just getting started, we used the default name, item. That’s a terrible name for a variable!\n\n\nHere are some tips:\n\nUse the yellow “plus” button near the top-left of the simmer window to make the variables die1 and die2.\nAfter you make a block that sets a variable, you can use the menu in that variable block to change which variable it refers to. You can also use that menu to change the variable’s name.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you run your program, simmer will create a column in your CODAP table for every variable in your program. That means you can calculate the sum of the two dice in CODAP.\n\nmake a new column with a formula for the sum of the two dice.\nmake a graph of that sum.\n\nIf you know the theory, you know it’s suppose to look like a pyramid. Does it look the way you expect? Is seven the most popular sum?\nIf not, add a few hundred cases. See if it gets closer to the “official” result.\nNow for something really cool:\n\nImagine a graph with die1 plotted against die2. Stop and think: what will that graph look like?\nMake a new graph and do that plot. Did it look the way you expected?\n\nDid you collapse your code so that you could see the graph better? Don’t forget that tip!\n\nIn the graph of sum, select all the cases with a sum of 5.\n\nYour screen might now look something like this:\n\n\nLook at the other graph, and think about what that means. Use selection in this way to make a convincing argument why seven is the most common result, and why 2 and 12 are the rarest.\n\n\nReflecting\nYou made a probability model using simmer, simulating throws of two dice.\nUsing a “repeat” block—a loop structure— you could throw lots of dice, many more than would be practical in real life.\nFinally, you used the results to learn more about how probability works."

(It’s probably still not very evenly distributed.)\nChange the number of repeats to a few hundred and run it again.\nSee if the graph shows that item has a more even distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe screen is getting crowded. It’s hard to work with the program, the graph, and the table at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npro tip: collapsing the code\n\n\n\nIn the simmer top bar you’ll see a [currently brown] square showing four arrows pointing inward. Press it to collapse the program so you have more space for data analysis.\nThen, when you want to program again, press the button to give yourself room to code."
