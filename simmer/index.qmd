## Simmer

With `simmer`, you can use block programming to simulate probability experiments, among other things.

This guide assumes you have some CODAP skills:

-   You can make graphs.
-   You can make a new attribute (a new column) and give it a simple formula.

Do the three lessons you can see in the sidebar.

### Simmer in a new tab

If you want to experiment outside of this guide, click the link below to open a `simmer` document in a new tab. You'll have more space.

Bookmark it so you can `simmer` again whenever you want.
