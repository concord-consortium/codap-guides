## Examples

Here are links to a number of more sophisticated examples of `simmer` 
programming and the data that they can generate.

These all have a particular form, which you might find useful:

* They begin by defining a bunch of variables and giving then initial values.
* Then there is a loop that produces data.

One way to use the program is to change one or more of the initial values and then run it again. 
What effect did changing those values have on the results? 
Why is that?

Of course, you should make a graph---or two or three---to display your results,
and change those graphs as necessary as you learn more.


### Simulated Fbola test results

We often use "Fbola" as the name of a fake disease (like Ebola but Fake). 
In this simulation, we have a test for the disease, but it's not perfect.

You will see parameters for the accuracy of the test in the program. 
You might even change the program so that these parameters are variables that get output with the other data.

The key Bayesian question you should answer right away is,
"If I test positive, what's the probability that I have the disease?"

### The Game of Pig

A text box in the document describes this important and venerable game. 

One task is to create an optimal strategy for the game. 
In this program,a parameter called `limit` governs when you stop rolling the die.
What's the best value for `limit`?

But there are other possible strategies that don;t involve a `limit`!
Implementing those requires altering the program, or creating a new one altogether.

### Projectile

This is something different: no probability at all.

Instead, it's physics: a numerical simulation of projectile motion. 

This is very unsophisticated, using the bare minimum Euler's method kind of calculation.
No Runge-Kutta! 
Not even Simpson's Rule!
But it still looks interesting, 
and we can explore, among other things, 
how accurate this simple-minded calculation can be.
