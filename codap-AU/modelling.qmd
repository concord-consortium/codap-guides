## Mathematical modelling {#modelling-page}

Modelling is a vast topic.
There are many forms of mathematical modelling:
we make systems models, conceptual models, and probability models;
we construct simulations to model phenomena. 
The list goes on. 

Right now, let's look at another kind of model 
central to school mathematics:
using a mathematical function to approximate data
from some phenomenon.

Here's what we do:

* Reach into a container of glass beads and pull out a few, 
up to about 20.
* Count the beads and record the number.
* Put the beads in a bowl and weigh them. ^[Note: do not "tare" the scale.
The weight will be the bowl plus the beads.
Do not alert the students to this!]
* Enter the `count` and the `weight` into a CODAP table. 
* Put the beads back, mix, and repeat.

Then, of course, we will plot the data
(what goes on the horizontal axis??) and try to 
find a function that fits the data. 

You already know how to make a graph.
To make a line,
go to the ruler palette of the graph and choose `Movable Line`.
Drag its handles to approximate the data.
Notice how the slope-intercept form of the line 
appears _and updates_ as you drag.

A situation like this leads to some great questions such as:

* Suppose we put 100 beads in the bowl. How much would that weigh?
* Suppose the bowl with the beads weighed 1 kg. 
How many beads would that be?
* In the formula you got, what number is the slope?
* What does that slope _mean_?
* Same for the intercept...

These lead to more subtle and statistical questions...

* Why don't the points line up perfectly?
* Remember that number you got for 1 kg of beads? How precise is that? What _range_ of numbers do you think you would typically get?
* Looking at the formula in the figure, do you think
it's possible that the true formula is `weight = 2 * count + 100`?

### More commentary

**Functional form**. 
We deliberately used a linear example, but you can go deeper.
That ruler palette has a `Plotted Function` option,
and you can use sliders (from the toolbar)
to make variable parameters.

**Data sources**.  Here we used measurement data,
which has built-in variability.
That's great, but it's not the only way.
Imagine one of those pattern problems where you count squares or triangles or dots.
You could enter those numbers as data and plot them to find the (in this case, quadratic) function:

**Best fit**. 
The ruler palette will let you make a least-squares line. 
Before you do that, however consider: the least-squares line is not all that much better 
than what students will come up with using the movable line.
Furthermore, think of what students might gain by 
moving those handles and seeing the formula change.
